Be aware that this WILL replace your old inflation system
Also, you need VRCFury for this

You can always refer to the installation video if you need visuals
(Should be included in the zip file this came in)
(if not; then it can be found at https://sapah.carrd.co/#freebies)


========INSTRUCTIONS=======

1) Drag and drop the prefab inside the root of your avatar

*If your avatar already has an inflation animation then you can skip this

*2a) Create a duplicate of the avatar and create an inflation animation;
The animation must have the initial state (0 inflation) at the first frame
and the final frame must be the final state (100 inflation)
final frame can be put at any time, just has to happen after the first one

*2b)Select the animation file, untick loop time


3) Find the FX animator of your avatar and add float called "ANIN/InflationTugcord/Output" without the quotes then:


4a)If the original inflation animation is a blendtree:

Go find it and replace its parameter to "ANIN/InflationTugcord/Output"

4b)If the original inflation animation is a motion time animation:

Go find it and replace its motion time parameter to "ANIN/InflationTugcord/Output"

*4c)If you *DID NOT* skip step 2:

*Find the original inflation animation in the animator and disable it via any of these methods:
*deleting the layer
*setting layer weight to 0
*making an empty transition
*deleting the state itself

*THEN:

*Drag and drop the new inflation animation you created, and set motion time to this parameter
"ANIN/InflationTugcord/Output"  



The tugcord should be working now, but:


5) Currently this breaks any basic radial you might have for the inflation, to fix this you must add 
"ANIN/InflationTugcord/Input" without the quotes to your vrchat parameter list

6) then go find the menu asset that contains the original inflation radial and replace its parameter with "ANIN/InflationTugcord/Input" 



NOTES:

An additional thing is that you can modify your animation to scale the gameobject called "CollarScale Proxy" if its clipping with the neck on its final state

There are customization options, find the mesh renderer of the tugcord and check the shapekeys!
