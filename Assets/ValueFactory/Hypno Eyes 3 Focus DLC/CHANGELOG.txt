## Version 3.0.3
* Changed how stencils work a bit: there is now a 'simple' and 'front and back' mode.
  Stencils are set to 'simple' by default, which will provide stencil options for all faces.
  The 'front and back' provides individual stencil settings for the back and front faces. This mode only takes effect when the material is locked.

	This change was done as the front and back options were not properly working previously. A toggle between the two modes was needed for the front and back stencil options to work properly.

== Version 3.0.2
* Added a 'Distance Fade (Entire Focus)' option that will fade the whole focus out based off of distance from the focus center (as opposed to the distance of the individual pixels)
* Fixed some issues with alpha blending when using transparency with edge fade.
