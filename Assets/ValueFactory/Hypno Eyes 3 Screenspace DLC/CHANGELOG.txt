## Version 3.0.3
* Changed how stencils work a bit: there is now a 'simple' and 'front and back' mode.
  Stencils are set to 'simple' by default, which will provide stencil options for all faces.
  The 'front and back' provides individual stencil settings for the back and front faces. This mode only takes effect when the material is locked.

	This change was done as the front and back options were not properly working previously. A toggle between the two modes was needed for the front and back stencil options to work properly.

== Version 3.0
* Public 3.0 release.

== Version 3.0-alpha1
* Version 3.0 compatibility.

== Version 1.0.2 - 2023-04-11  ==
* Added a parameter to hide the screenspace effect in mirrors.
  This is on by default!

== Version 1.0.1 - 2023-03-31  ==

* Moved non-transparent materials to the 1001 render queue. (thanks, @Storm, for the report!)
  This will stop any of the material presets from applying to the skybox instead of the cube you want to drag them onto.

	You'll likely want to update your materials to use the 1001 render queue if this was something you kept running to!

	Keep in mind only non-transparent materials were affected. If your render queue was above 3000, you're fine.
