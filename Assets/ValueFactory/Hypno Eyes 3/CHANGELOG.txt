## Version 3.2
* New material locking system that's faster and more robust.
* Added Northern Aspil preset.
* Added Fox Moth UV preset.
* Added RegalFin UV preset (submitted by RegalFin)

## Version 3.1.1
* Added a 'time scale' parameter to the advanced settings that controls the global speed of all speed parameters on a material.
* Disabled d4rkOptimizer from running on the hypno shader.

## Version 3.1.0.4
* Fixed a rare issue with the license verification that could lead to an exception being thrown on some machines.

## Version 3.1.0.3
* Make d4rkAvatarOptimizer not try to optimize the shader (locking already does that!)
* Moved "VF Hypno 3" to "ValueFactory/Hypno 3" in Project context menus.

## Version 3.1.0.2
* Added a warning that shows if a spiral doesn't have a color gradient texture set.

## Version 3.1.0.1
* Fixed the 'Custom Properties' tab showing a warning header.

## Version 3.1
* Added a third decal slot.
* Decals can now write into aux modulators.

## Version 3.0.3
* Changed how stencils work a bit: there is now a 'simple' and 'front and back' mode.
  Stencils are set to 'simple' by default, which will provide stencil options for all faces.
  The 'front and back' provides individual stencil settings for the back and front faces. This mode only takes effect when the material is locked.

	This change was done as the front and back options were not properly working previously. A toggle between the two modes was needed for the front and back stencil options to work properly.

## Version 3.0.2.1
* Added avatar preset for Faelyn.
* Added avatar preset for Astrawolf.

## Version 3.0.2
* Support focus changes (see focus changelog)

## Version 3.0.1.2
* Added support for Lemon Squeezy license verification.

## Version 3.0.1.1
* Fixed the license authentication window sometimes showing up when entering play mode. (thanks Davilos for the help!)

## Version 3.0.1
* Added a 'Tips & Useful Things' section to the manual.
* Updated the licensing system to communicate with shader.gay servers instead.
  Licenses are only checked every 48 hours now, so it's possible to continue using the shader without internet access during the 48 hours a license is valid.
	* Added a privacy policy to the licensing: https://shader.gay/privacy.html

## Version 3.0

* Editor
	* Added a random gradient generator to the gradient editor.
	* UI Improvements.
	* Copy/paste/reset also works with animated states now.
	* Manual improvements.

* Shader
	* Added a dissolve modulator.
	* Dithered transparency defaults to a low-resolution dither to avoid artifacts on certain HMDs. This can be toggled off.

* Presets
	* Tweaked some default shader values.
	* Added more presets.
	* Organized stuff some more.
	* Prefab tweaks and additions to DLC.

## Version 3.0-alpha7
* Shader
	* BREAKING: log spirals do not mirror the gradient by default anymore. Added a 'Mirror Gradient' option which will mirror it. This is off by deafult.
	* Added a 'shadowing' feature to log and simple spirals which add shadows in between repetitions.
	* Added a pulsing intensity value to simple spiral pulsing.
	* Added a regular square shape.
	* Fixed some bugs.

* Presets

	* Screenspace: Added the mask prefab.
	* Focus: Added the focus VRCFury prefab.
	* Updated some avatar presets.

* Editor
	* Added documentation to the shaders.
	* Added a manual.
	* Added interpolator optimization that runs during locking.
	* Tweaked some defaults.
	* Tweaked internal lighting parameters.
	* Fixed some bugs.

## Version 3.0-alpha6
* Shader
	* BREAKING: Changed how the offset parameter works for hue shift textures, distortion textures and decals. If any one of these is off, you'll want to subtract 0.5 from the x and y of the offset parameter of any of these textures.
	* BREAKING: Reworked how the 'polygon' shape works on the simple spiral to be wayyyy better.
	* Adjusted how the gradient is mapped to the log spiral so that it's linear.
	* Added a 'Don't Repeat' option to the simple spiral.
	* Fixed vignette blending modes not working properly.

* Presets
	* Converted a bunch of the old 2.0 materials to 3.0.
	* Added a bunch of pride flag presets.
	* Updated the 'Calibration' preset.

* Editor
	* Gradients are now saved in a 'Gradients' folder located in the same folder as the material.
	* Fixed some editor bugs.

## Version 3.0-alpha5

* Shader
	* Added 'distance color fade' to the special fx tab.
	* Added GSAA to the lighting tab.
	* Fixed hue shift by repetition not working with sidewards gradient.
	* Added an "Always in front" toggle for focuses
	* Added an "Touch reactivity compatibility" toggle in 'Rendering' for the normal shader

* Editor
	* Added copy & paste from clipboard to the manual input of uv centers.
	* Added a list of gradient textures for enabled spirals in the quick setup tab.
	* Show warnings when the material state differs from the rendering setting recommended state.
	* Editor tweaks.

## Version 3.0-alpha4

* Shader
	* BREAKING: Replaced "Use Mod UV" with a "UV Type" dropdown that is more versatile with "Decal", "Distance" and "Follows shape" options. Closest option to "Use Mod UV" would be to use the "Follows Shape" option.
	* BREAKING: Removed modulator spirals. Any spiral can now write into 'Aux 1-3' modulator slots. All spirals now also have an option to hide them. Both are available in the 'Advanced' tab on each spiral. The modulator spirals remain in the UI but have no functionality. Take advantage of this to migrate materials that use spiral modulators to not use them anymore by copying the deprecated modulator spirals and pasting them into the normal use and adjusting which Aux modulator they write into. This was done for compilation and upload time optimizations.
	* BREAKING: Removed a bunch of the esoteric blend modes and only kept "Normal" "Add" "Multiply" "Difference" "Subtract". This was done for compilation and upload time optimizations. Blend modes may be added back if they are needed.
	* Added a 'Lighting' tab that contains options for realistic PBR lighting using the Filament standard BRDF. Contains options for metallic, roughness and normal maps, clear coat, directional light override, specular override, direct/indirect diffuse/specular contribution weights and emission amount.

* Editor
	* Disabled compiler optimization in the editor in order to speed up compile times in the editor.

## Version 3.0-alpha3

* Shader
	* Added a 'Perceptual Color Shift' toggle to 'Rendering' that'll make all hue shifting shift in a	way that has uniform lightness per hue (using oklab). This is on by default.
	* Added a final opacity map texture.
	* Added a matcap to special fx.
	* Added glossiness to special fx.
	* Added a Color shift to the spirals tab that'll just effect the spirals.
	* Added a 'Offset' parameter to simple modulators that offsets the time. Useful if you want to turn the sin oscillator into a cos oscillator for circular motion: set the offset to 3.1415/2
	* Added offset and tiling to decals, overlays, opacity map, dissolve noise.
	* BREAKING: the uv source for overlay textures will need to be reconfigured if it was set to anything other than UV0.

* Focus:
	* BREAKING: The forward offset variable will need to be reconfigured.
	* Added an 'Offset' tab with XYZ offset parameters.
	* Added a 'Depth Fade' option that will fade out the focus if it gets too close to the camera. Will fix situations where the focus feels like it's clipping into a mirror.
	* Tweaked focus editor UI, fixed some bugs.

* Editor
	* Moved the UV source selection into the dropdown for textures.
	* Renamed HSV to color shift.
	* Moved the 'overlay' and 'decal' out of the 'texture' tab into their own big tabs.

== Version 2.7.0.7 - 2023-12-15 ==
* Separated the contacts into their own folder as both the compatibility tester and the full
package utilize them.

== Version 2.7.0.6 - 2023-08-17 ==
* Added Ember (Foxipaws) UV Centers.

== Version 2.7.0.5 - 2023-08-15 ==

* Fixed auto-fix buttons not appearing for materials that have improper blend modes when transparent
  rendering is off.

== Version 2.7.0.1 - 2023-03-31 ==
* The Screenspace DLC material editor will now offer auto-fixes to set the render queue of non-transparent materials to 1001 when it's less than 1001. (thanks, Storm, for the report!)

  This will stop any of the material presets from applying to the skybox instead of the cube you want to drag them onto.

	You'll likely want to update your materials to use the 1001 render queue if this was something you kept running to!

	Keep in mind only non-transparent materials were affected. If your render queue was above 3000, you're fine.

  various render settings relating to transparent rendering.
* Fixed an issue where hue modulation would result in div by zero in the log spiral if Size is set
  to zero. (thanks Maple!)
* Fixed duplicate parameters in the Log Spiral shader causing compilation errors in rare situations (thanks, Seedsy, for the report!)

* Improved material preview displays.
* Adjusted the UI of material editors.

== Version 2.6.2 - 2023-02-15 ==

* Fixed single pass rendering. Currently irrelevant for VRChat but relevant for CVR users!
* Added center presets for Yet Another Fox https://emperorofmars.itch.io/yaf (thanks, LakesideMiners!)
* Added center presets for Lykana https://lykana.gumroad.com/l/Lykana (thanks, Vivi!)

== Version 2.6.1 - 2023-01-18 ==
* Add the ability to use different UV sets for UV centers to be used for the Log, 1D and Polar
  shaders.

	With this you'd be able to use the UV center method with eyes that have a non-circular UV unwrap
	by default. In these situations, you'd create a new UV set on the mesh and unwrap the eyes to have
	circular UVs with a center, then set the material to use that UV set. 

	Eye textures will not be broken as they'd still use the base UV set!

* Added Dergodal centers (thanks, @WelshAnomaly)

* Removed the 'Layer Jiggle Frequency' Parallax 3D parameter as it was no longer necessary.
* Removed [Toggle] attributes on shader parameters.
* Removed INSTRUCTIONS.txt 
* Hoisted some center related code into the vertex shader as an optimization.

== Version 1.6 - 2022-07-17 ==

* Added the single eye mode.
	* You can use this to achieve more complex asymmetric effects. Best used with a separate left and
	  right material slot for the eyes.
	* The protogen materials use this mode by default as they do not have left/right eyes.

  cultures, including creating shaders that fail to compile due to the culture defaulting to using a
  comma as a decimal separator instead of a period. (thanks, @Guuvita, for the report!)

== Version 1.2 - 2022-06-02 ==

* Fixed the material locker crashing when there is mesh on an avatar or in the world that has a material slot
  that has not been assigned a material. (thanks, @SaltySnickerBE, for the report!)

== Version 1.1 - 2022-06-01 ==

* Added UV centers for the Kirin, Rexouium and the Nardodragon. (contributed by @Shalkor_L_D, @SaltySnickerBE)
* The button for the current used preset will now show as being green so it's obvious which preset
  you're using.
* Added a CREDITS.txt file.
